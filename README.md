# MusicToasts ðŸŽ¶

**Discover interesting facts about the song you're listening to with a simple toast notification!**

Did you know that _"Bohemian Rhapsody"_ by _Queen_ was initially called "The Cowboy Song"?  
Or that _"Rolling in the Deep"_ by _Adele_ was inspired by a dream where her house burned down?  
Or that the guitar solo in _"Hotel California"_ by _Eagles_ was recorded in a bathroom for its reverb effect?   
<small>(at least that's what the AI says...)</small>

**Curious to learn more about the song currently playing?**  
_**MusicToasts**_ displays a toast notification with song details (title and artist) and album art (if available) when a
new track starts playing on your computer.
It also offers a fun fact about the song, generated by AI, and an "ask me anything about this song" button for
further information!

## Installation

### Requirements

- Windows >= 10
- Python >= 3.8
- Only works with apps that support the Windows 10 Media Session API (e.g., Windows Media Player, Spotify, Browser +
  Spotify Web, etc.)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/Adioffer/MusicToasts
    ```

1. Install the dependencies.
    ``` bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1. Configure environment variables (example below).
    ``` bash
    set MT_AI_ENDPOINT_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions
    set MT_AI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
    set MT_AI_MODEL=deepseek-chat
    ```
   (use setx for permanent changes).

   I recommend using DeepSeek model, as it is (almost) state-of-the-art, and 2 bucks can get you about 50K requests.

    python src\main.py
    ```
